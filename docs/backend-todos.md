- [x] Create detailed `README.md` with setup and start instructions

- [x] Implement `user.model.js` (fields: name, email, password, role; indexes as per plan)
- [x] Implement `product.model.js` (fields: name, description, stock, pricing, images, createdBy; indexes)
- [x] Implement `rentalOrder.model.js` (fields: customer, product, startTime, endTime, totalPrice, status, lateFee, createdAt; compound index)
- [x] Export models and ensure all indexes are created

- [x] Implement `auth.controller.js` (register, login endpoints) with rate limiting and security
- [x] Hash passwords with `bcryptjs` on register (salt rounds: 12)
- [x] Generate JWT on login/register with enhanced security
- [x] Implement `auth.middleware.js` (JWT verification, attach user to req)
- [x] Implement `isAdmin` role guard middleware + `optionalAuth`
- [x] Add comprehensive input validation for auth endpoints with `express-validator`

- [x] Implement `product.controller.js` (CRUD: create, read, update, delete) with caching
- [x] Implement `product.routes.js` (admin protected, validation)
- [x] Add validation for product fields (name, stock, pricing)
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling for not found, validation errors

### Phase B â€” Availability Engine & Booking (100% COMPLETE)
- [x] Implement `/api/rentals/check-availability` endpoint in `rental.controller.js`
	- [x] Use optimized overlap query and caching logic
	- [x] Validate input (productId, startTime, endTime, qty)
	- [x] Added performance monitoring and caching
- [x] Implement `/api/rentals/calculate-price` endpoint
	- [x] Use `calcPrice.js` utility for price calculation
	- [x] Validate input and handle edge cases

- [x] Implement `/api/rentals/create` endpoint with enterprise-grade reliability
	- [x] Use MongoDB session transaction and retry logic (3 attempts)
	- [x] Re-check availability inside transaction (atomic)
	- [x] Return order on success, detailed error on failure
	- [x] Added exponential backoff for retry attempts

- [x] Implement `/api/rentals` endpoint (admin: all, user: mine) with filtering
	- [x] Support filtering by status, pagination (`?limit=20&page=1`)
	- [x] Performance optimized with lean queries and indexes
- [x] Implement `/api/rentals/:id/status` endpoint (PATCH)
	- [x] Allow status change (confirmed, picked_up, returned, cancelled)
	- [x] Calculate late fee if returned late with configurable rules
- [x] Implement `/api/rentals/stats` endpoint for admin dashboard metrics

- [x] Create comprehensive `scripts/seed.js` to populate DB with:
	- [x] 2 admins, 4 customers, 8 diverse products (vary stock/pricing)
	- [x] Multiple overlapping orders to demo non-availability scenarios
	- [x] Demo accounts: `admin@demo.com / p@ssw0rd`, `user@demo.com / p@ssw0rd`
	- [x] Color-coded console output and detailed seeding information

- [x] Implement `error.middleware.js` (central error handler, returns consistent format)
- [x] Add `morgan` logging with request IDs and performance tracking
- [x] Add `helmet` for security headers with CSP policies
- [x] Enable CORS for allowed origins with security configurations
- [x] Add compression, rate limiting, mongo sanitization, HPP protection

### Phase C â€” Performance & Security Enhancements (100% COMPLETE)
- [x] Advanced logging system with Winston (request IDs, performance timers)
- [x] Product and availability caching with TTL (30s products, 10s availability)
- [x] Request rate limiting (tiered: auth 10/15min, general 1000/15min)
- [x] Input sanitization and validation (40+ validation rules)
- [x] MongoDB connection pooling and optimization
- [x] Login attempt tracking and account lockout protection
- [x] Performance monitoring with timer tracking
- [x] Graceful error handling with detailed error types
- [x] Memory-efficient lean queries for high-performance operations

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT PRIORITY â€” Testing & Polish

### Phase D â€” Testing, Polish & Demo Readiness
- [x] Add comprehensive `scripts/stress-test.js` (concurrent booking tests)
	- [x] Tests 10+ concurrent bookings for race conditions
	- [x] Performance benchmarking for all endpoints
	- [x] Availability stress testing (100+ concurrent checks)
	- [x] Authentication rate limiting verification
- [x] Add status color chips in API responses (ready for frontend)
- [x] Add helpful error messages and microcopy for all edge cases
- [x] Ensure all endpoints return consistent error format with request IDs

- [ ] **NEXT: Write Jest unit tests for critical business logic**
	- [ ] Availability calculation edge cases
	- [ ] Price calculation with different units/durations  
	- [ ] Booking transaction rollback scenarios
	- [ ] Auth middleware security tests
- [ ] **NEXT: Integration testing with Supertest**
	- [ ] End-to-end booking flow tests
	- [ ] Admin workflow tests
	- [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] Run stress test script and fix any identified issues
- [ ] Load testing with realistic user scenarios

### Phase E â€” Production Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Prepare production environment variables
- [ ] Security audit checklist completion
- [ ] Performance optimization final review
- [ ] Deploy backend to production platform
- [ ] Setup monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Final demo rehearsal with golden path verification


## Best Practices & Checklist

- [x] Keep secrets out of repo (`.env` only, use `.env.example`)
- [x] Strict input validation everywhere (manual or `express-validator`)
- [x] Store and operate on UTC for all times
- [x] Ensure DB indexes on all query fields
- [x] Use central error handling middleware
- [x] Use `morgan` + custom logger for all requests
- [x] Paginate admin rentals, use projection to limit payload
- [x] Use transactions for booking creation (as per plan)
- [x] Seed demo accounts and products for testing/demo
- [ ] Document all start commands and API usage in README
- [x] No sensitive data in logs or responses
- [x] Use ESLint and Prettier for code style
- [x] Keep code modular, DRY, and well-commented
- [ ] Update docs and README after code changes

### Deliverables
- [ ] Fully functional backend with all endpoints and logic
- [ ] Seed script and concurrent test script
- [ ] README with setup, usage, and demo script
